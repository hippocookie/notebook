# Multi-Threaded Index Concurrency Control

## Latches Overview

Locks

- Protects the database's logical contents from other transactions
- Held for transaction duration
- Need to be able to rollback changes

Latches

- Protects the critical sections of the DBMS's internal data structure from other threads
- Held for operation duration
- Do not need to be able to rollback changes

### Latch Modes

Read Mode

- Multiple threads can read the same object at the same time
- A thread can acquire the read latch if another thread has it in read mode

Write Mode

- Only one thread can access the object
- A thread cannot acquire a write latch if another thread holds the latch in any mode

### Lathc Implementations

- Blocking OS Mutex
- Test-and-Set Spin Latch(TAS)
- Reader-Writer Latch

## Hash Table Latching

Easy to support concurrent access, to resize the table, table a global latch on the entire table.

- All threads move in the same direction an only access a single page/slot at a time
- Deadlocks are not possible

### Page Latches

- Each page has its own reader-write latch that protects its entire contents
- Threads acquire either a read or write latch before the access a page

### Slot latches

- Each slot has its own latch
- Can use a single mode latch to reduce meta-data and computational overhead

## B+ Tree Latching

- Threads trying to modify the contents of a node at the same time
- One thread traversing the tree while another thread splits/merges nodes

### Latch Crabbing/Coupling

Protocol to allow multiple threads to access/modify B+ Tree at the same time.

- Get latch for parent
- Get latch for child
- Release latch for parent if safe (Safe node is one that will not split or merge when updated, not full on insert, more than half-full on delete)

Find: Start at root and go down; repeatedly, acquire R latch on child, then unlatch parent.

Insert/Delete: Start at root and go down, obtaining W latches as needed. Once child is latched, check if it is safe, if child is safe, release all latches on ancestors.
